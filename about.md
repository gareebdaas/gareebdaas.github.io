Hello friend! My name is **Apaar** (Just another computer geek).

I'm a Linux fan boy and a huge admirer of the [Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) culture and the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) run by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman).

By interest, I'm more inclined towards VAPT and mostly concerned about the security aspect of computers. Though, anything and everything about computers may interest me in general like BSD/Unix, retro Thinkpads, minimalist setups or even the 8 bit art and music (chiptune).

I'm mostly (only) active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gareebdaas) for interest based discussions (shitposting) and socializing (formality). For contact (abuse), you can DM me there.
